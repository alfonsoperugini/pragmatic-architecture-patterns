## The Partial WAF Problem

### The Hidden Danger of Inconsistent Protection

```yaml
Partial WAF Coverage Creates:
  False Security: "We have a WAF" ≠ "We are protected"
  Attack Vectors: Attackers find unprotected endpoints
  Compliance Gaps: Auditors require complete coverage
  Operational Chaos: Different rules, different behaviors
  Alert Fatigue: Inconsistent logging and monitoring
```

### Real-World Attack Scenario

```
Attacker's Perspective with Partial WAF:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Scan public endpoints                   │
│    ↓                                       │
│ 2. Find pattern:                          │
│    - api.company.com ✓ (WAF protected)    │
│    - api-v2.company.com ✗ (No WAF)        │
│    - mobile-api.company.com ✗ (No WAF)    │
│    - partner.company.com ✓ (WAF)          │
│    ↓                                       │
│ 3. Focus attacks on unprotected endpoints  │
│    ↓                                       │
│ 4. Exploit vulnerabilities:                │
│    - SQL injection on mobile-api          │
│    - XSS on api-v2                        │
│    - DDoS on unprotected endpoints        │
│    ↓                                       │
│ 5. Data breach through weakest link        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Current State Assessment

### Typical Partial WAF Deployment

Based on common enterprise patterns, your current state likely looks like:

```yaml
Protected Endpoints (30-40%):
  - Main website (www.company.com)
  - Primary API gateway (api.company.com)
  - Customer portal (portal.company.com)
  
Unprotected Endpoints (60-70%):
  - Legacy APIs (legacy-api.company.com)
  - Mobile APIs (mobile.company.com)
  - Partner APIs (partner-api.company.com)
  - Internal-facing APIs exposed to internet
  - Microservices with direct exposure
  - Regional endpoints (eu-api, asia-api)
  - Development/staging environments
```

### Assessment Framework

#### Step 1: Inventory All Public Endpoints

```bash
# Discovery Script Example
#!/bin/bash

# DNS enumeration
echo "=== DNS Enumeration ==="
dig axfr company.com
dnsrecon -d company.com -t std

# Certificate transparency logs
echo "=== Certificate Transparency ==="
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%.company.com&output=json" | \
  jq -r '.[].name_value' | sort -u

# Cloud provider inventory (AWS example)
echo "=== AWS Resources ==="
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query \
  'LoadBalancers[?Scheme==`internet-facing`].[DNSName]'
aws apigateway get-rest-apis --query 'items[].name'
aws cloudfront list-distributions --query \
  'DistributionList.Items[].DomainName'

# Results format:
# endpoint,has_waf,waf_type,exposure_level,data_sensitivity
```

#### Step 2: WAF Coverage Matrix

| Endpoint Category | Count | WAF Protected | Percentage | Risk Level |
|------------------|-------|---------------|------------|------------|
| Customer-facing APIs | 25 | 10 | 40% | CRITICAL |
| Partner APIs | 15 | 3 | 20% | HIGH |
| Mobile APIs | 10 | 2 | 20% | CRITICAL |
| Admin Interfaces | 8 | 8 | 100% | LOW |
| Legacy Systems | 20 | 0 | 0% | CRITICAL |
| Static Content | 30 | 25 | 83% | LOW |
| **TOTAL** | **108** | **48** | **44%** | **HIGH** |

#### Step 3: Risk Scoring

```yaml
Risk Score Calculation:
  For each unprotected endpoint:
    Base Score = Data_Sensitivity × Exposure_Level × Attack_History
    
  Data_Sensitivity:
    - PII/PCI/PHI: 10
    - Business Critical: 8
    - Internal Data: 5
    - Public Data: 2
    
  Exposure_Level:
    - Internet-facing, no auth: 10
    - Internet-facing, basic auth: 7
    - Internet-facing, strong auth: 5
    - VPN required: 2
    
  Attack_History:
    - Previously attacked: 3
    - Similar endpoints attacked: 2
    - No known attacks: 1
    
  Risk = Base_Score × (1 + Compliance_Required)
```

## Security Gap Analysis

### Current Vulnerability Exposure

#### Without Consistent WAF:

```yaml
Active Vulnerabilities:
  
  SQL Injection:
    Protected endpoints: 0% vulnerable (WAF blocks)
    Unprotected endpoints: 15-30% vulnerable
    Annual incidents: 5-10 successful attacks
    
  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
    Protected endpoints: 0% vulnerable
    Unprotected endpoints: 25-40% vulnerable
    Annual incidents: 10-20 successful attacks
    
  DDoS Attacks:
    Protected endpoints: Mitigated in <1 minute
    Unprotected endpoints: 15-60 minute outages
    Annual incidents: 3-5 major events
    
  OWASP Top 10:
    Protected coverage: 90% of vulnerabilities
    Unprotected coverage: 10% (basic app security)
    Gap: 80% vulnerability exposure
```

### Attack Pattern Analysis

```yaml
Recent 12-Month Attack Data (Typical Enterprise):
  
  Total Attacks Attempted: 1,250,000
  
  Against WAF-Protected Endpoints:
    - Attempts: 750,000 (60%)
    - Blocked: 749,500 (99.93%)
    - Successful: 500 (0.07%)
    
  Against Unprotected Endpoints:
    - Attempts: 500,000 (40%)
    - Blocked by app: 50,000 (10%)
    - Successful: 450,000 (90%)
    
  Key Insight: Attackers are succeeding 90% of the time
  on unprotected endpoints vs 0.07% on protected ones
```

### Data Breach Scenarios

```yaml
Breach Through Unprotected Endpoint:
  
  Scenario 1: SQL Injection on Legacy API
    Entry Point: legacy-api.company.com/user/search
    Vulnerability: Unfiltered user input
    Impact: 500,000 customer records exposed
    Cost: $4.5M (fines, remediation, reputation)
    
  Scenario 2: XSS on Partner Portal
    Entry Point: partner.company.com/dashboard
    Vulnerability: Reflected XSS in search
    Impact: Partner credentials stolen
    Cost: $2.1M (partner compensation, fixes)
    
  Scenario 3: API Abuse on Mobile Endpoint
    Entry Point: mobile-api.company.com/products
    Vulnerability: No rate limiting
    Impact: Complete product database scraped
    Cost: $1.3M (competitive disadvantage)
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated discovery script

echo "=== Endpoint Discovery ==="

# AWS Resources
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers \
  --query 'LoadBalancers[?Scheme==`internet-facing`]' \
  --output json > aws_endpoints.json

# Azure Resources  
az network application-gateway list \
  --query '[].{name:name, frontendIpConfigurations:frontendIpConfigurations}' \
  > azure_endpoints.json

# GCP Resources
gcloud compute forwarding-rules list \
  --format="json" > gcp_endpoints.json

# DNS Records
dig @8.8.8.8 company.com ANY +noall +answer > dns_records.txt

# Certificate Transparency
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%.company.com&output=json" | \
  jq -r '.[].name_value' | sort -u > ssl_certificates.txt

# Consolidate and analyze
python3 analyze_endpoints.py
```

#### Week 3-4: Risk Assessment

```python
# Risk scoring algorithm
def calculate_risk_score(endpoint):
    """Calculate risk score for prioritization"""
    
    # Base scores
    data_sensitivity_scores = {
        'pii': 10, 'pci': 10, 'phi': 10,
        'confidential': 8, 'internal': 5, 'public': 2
    }
    
    exposure_scores = {
        'internet_no_auth': 10,
        'internet_basic_auth': 7,
        'internet_strong_auth': 5,
        'vpn_required': 2
    }
    
    # Calculate base risk
    base_risk = (
        data_sensitivity_scores.get(endpoint.data_type, 5) *
        exposure_scores.get(endpoint.exposure, 5)
    )
    
    # Multipliers
    if endpoint.compliance_required:
        base_risk *= 2
    
    if endpoint.previous_incidents > 0:
        base_risk *= (1 + endpoint.previous_incidents * 0.5)
    
    if endpoint.traffic_volume > 1000000:  # High traffic
        base_risk *= 1.5
    
    return base_risk

# Prioritize endpoints
endpoints.sort(key=lambda x: calculate_risk_score(x), reverse=True)
```

#### Week 5-8: Phased Rollout

```yaml
Rollout Schedule:
  
  Week 5 - Critical APIs (Risk Score >80):
    Monday: Deploy WAF in monitor mode
    Tuesday-Wednesday: Analyze traffic patterns
    Thursday: Enable blocking for OWASP Top 10
    Friday: Review and adjust
    
  Week 6 - High-Risk APIs (Risk Score 60-80):
    Monday-Tuesday: Deploy and tune
    Wednesday: Enable partial blocking
    Thursday-Friday: Full blocking
    
  Week 7 - Medium-Risk (Risk Score 40-60):
    Accelerated deployment (2 days per group)
    Focus on automation
    
  Week 8 - Low-Risk (Risk Score <40):
    Bulk deployment
    Standard ruleset
    Monitor only for internal endpoints
```

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

```yaml
Common Mistakes and Solutions:

1. Blocking Legitimate Traffic:
   Problem: False positives break applications
   Solution:
     - Always start in monitor mode
     - Maintain whitelist of known good patterns
     - Implement gradual enforcement
     - Have rollback plan ready
     
2. Performance Degradation:
   Problem: WAF adds unacceptable latency
   Solution:
     - Use CDN-integrated WAF
     - Implement caching strategies
     - Optimize rule processing order
     - Consider geographic distribution
     
3. Alert Fatigue:
   Problem: Too many alerts, team ignores them
   Solution:
     - Tune rules to reduce false positives
     - Implement alert prioritization
     - Use ML-based anomaly detection
     - Create actionable alert categories
     
4. Incomplete Coverage:
   Problem: New endpoints bypass WAF
   Solution:
     - Implement WAF-by-default in CI/CD
     - Regular automated discovery scans
     - Network segmentation enforcement
     - Default-deny network policies
     
5. Configuration Drift:
   Problem: WAF rules become inconsistent
   Solution:
     - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
     - Git-based change management
     - Automated compliance checking
     - Regular configuration audits
```
